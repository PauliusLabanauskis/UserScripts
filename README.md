# UserScripts
User scripts for GreaseMonkey.
I use these scripts to improve website usability on Firefox.

### Available scripts
* comment_collapser.js - Adds anchors to HackerNews comments to collapse and expand the comment groups.
* comment_coloring.js - Adds a lighter shade of color to alternating comments in HackerNews. Helps with readability and seeing the hierarchy of comments.
* comment_filter.js - Filters the comments according to the search text phrase. There is a regular expressions support of the phrase is between `/` symbols, e.g.: `/[a-z]+?/`.
